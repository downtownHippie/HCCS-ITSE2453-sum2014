After I'd written a solution for this program I discussed it with a friend of mine about how
to make it more generic.  After some discussion we arrived at the basis for this structure.
This also moved all logic out of the gui and into the other objects.  I then added buttons
to create random lists of chars and strings to search.

He also taught me about static helper methods, so I used a modified Search method (signature)
to take advantage of this.
